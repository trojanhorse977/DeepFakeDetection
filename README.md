# Deepfake Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting deepfake videos by leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques. It includes preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and prediction to classify real and synthetic media accurately.

## Key Components
### 1. **Preprocessing**
   - Extracts frames from videos and applies transformations for noise reduction and feature enhancement.
   - Utilizes deep learning-based face detection and alignment techniques to focus on key facial regions.

### 2. **Model Training**
   - Implements a deep learning model trained on labeled datasets of real and fake videos.
   - Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques to improve accuracy.
   - Optimizes the model using various loss functions and hyperparameter tuning.

### 3. **Prediction & Evaluation**
   - Loads the trained model to classify new video samples.
   - Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Includes visualization of results to understand model decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, **OpenCV**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-Learn**
- Deepfake detection datasets (e.g., **FaceForensics++**, **Celeb-DF**)

## How to Use
1. **Preprocess Data**: Run the `preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to extract and prepare video frames.
2. **Train Model**: Use `Model_and_train_csv.ipynb` to train the model on the dataset.
3. **Predict**: Load a new video and classify it using `Predict.ipynb`.

## Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy with more advanced architectures.
- Explore real-time deepfake detection.
- Integrate explainability techniques to interpret model predictions.
